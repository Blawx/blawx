# Installation

The repository is in a very early state. If you need assistance, open an issue in GitHub,
and the answer to your question will be added to this file.

Blawx's back end requires an Apache server with PHP, Node.js, the node version of Blockly, Python 3, and Flora-2 (AKA ErgoLite).

Blawx's front end is javascript, html, and needs access to the front-end Blockly libraries.

reasoner.php should be in /usr/lib/cgi-bin
All other files should be in /var/www/html
Flora-2 is expected at /opt/Flora-2/
